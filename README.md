# Challenge_4_PyCitySchools

Analysis of School and Student data using the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.

1. Summarize the analysis.

PyCity Schools’ data set showed math and reading scores across 15 schools. These 15 schools could be divided into two categories: Charter schools and District schools. The overall math& reading passing percentage was calculated based on the percentage of schools that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher. This data set analysis consisted of school and district summary, also listed top 5 highest performing schools& bottom 5 lowest performing schools. Score analyses were conducted from four aspects: grade, school spending, school size, and school type.

2. Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations.

a. Charter schools out-performed the district schools across reading and math. This could be verified by noting that the top 5 performing schools were all charter schools. They are all medium sized schools had smaller budget-around 1 million or below. So, the effect may due to charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school. The bottom 5 lowest performing schools were district schools. They had larger school budgets & larger student population, while lower passing rates.

b. According to the math/reading scores by Grade, both math and reading scores are consistent among grade 9 – 12 students. In general, students have higher reading scores compared to their math scores
